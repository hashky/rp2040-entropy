# Raspberry Pi Pico Random Number Generator

** This fork includes an enhanced RNG to produce a true RNG. **

A basic random number generator that generates numbers from enviromental noise with the onboard DAC of the Raspberry Pi Pico. The project uses the Raspberry Pi Pico USB dev_lowlevel as a starting point. The Pico RNG is not meant to be FIPS 140-2 compliant as a stand-alone device by any means. However it does supply the Linux Kernel with random bits that is used with the appropriate entropy to achieve FIPS 140-2 compliant random numbers. Maybe one day the next gen Pico's will include an onboard crypto module.

## Project Goals
* Raspberry Pi Pico firmware generates random numbers as a USB Endpoint.
* Linux Kernel Module (aka driver) provides random numbers to the Kernel.
* Driver can transmit random numbers on demand to the system and/or user processes via a character device.


## Prerequisites

* Raspberry Pi Pico development environment. See [Raspberry Pi Pico Getting Started Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/)
* Linux Kernel development headers


## Building
The entire project uses CMake to keep with Rasberry Pi Pico's development environment and project setup instructions.

```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build

# Change to the build directory
cd build

# Run cmake
cmake ..

# Run make
make
```

## Install

The driver can be installed from the build directory using the traditional insmod command.

```bash
# Assumes CWD is 'build/'
# debug will enable debug log level
# timeout will set the usb endpoint timeout. Currently defaults to 100 msecs
sudo insmod driver/pico_rng.ko [debug=1] [timeout=<msec timeout>]
```

The Pico firmware is installed thorugh the normal process as outlined in the Raspberry Pi Pico Development Documentation.

* Unplug the Pico from the host.
* Plug the Pico into the host while holding the 'boot' button.
* Mount the Pico ```sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt```. Note /dev/sdb1 could be different you. Use ```sudo dmesg``` to find out what device the Pico shows up as on your system.
* Copy the uf2 file to the Pico ```sudo cp firmware/pico_rng.uf2 /mnt```.
* Umount the pico ```sudo umount /mnt```.

## Testing

You can test Pico RNG firmware with the [pico_rng_test.py](firmware/pico_rng_test.py) script.

```bash
# Running with --performance will measure the devices' KB/s.
# if the kernel module has been installed, then the test tool will use /dev/pico_rng otherwise python's libusb implementation will be used.
sudo firmware/pico_rng_test.py [--performance] [--size] [--endless]
```

You can also test the Kernel's random number pool that contains random numbers from the Pico
![Pico Random Numbers](pico-rng.gif)

## Analysis

A set of random samples can be analyzed with the [pico_rng_analyze.py](firmware/pico_rng_analyze.py) script.

For generating a set of samples, the following code can be executed:
```bash
$ python3 firmware/pico_rng_test.py --size 1073741824 > sample.rng
```
will produce a 1 GB file containing random bytes.

Then
```bash
$ python3 firmware/pico_rng_analyze.py sample.rng
```
will produce two figures:

![fig1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55573252/185908242-9fac9e7c-bfd2-440b-bd1d-045b571ed010.png)

Fig. 1 depicts the distribution of the bytes, from `0` to `255`. Ideally, it must be a uniform distribution, with mean equal to `127.5`.

![fig2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55573252/185908272-42973878-7c4f-45ec-8492-6878f8a0bfa6.png)

Fig. 2 depicts the distribution of chi square tests and excess percentages. Ideally, the distribution of chi square tests must follow a chi square distribution with mean at `255`. Excess percentage distribution must follow a uniform distribution.

Pico-rng is also tested with `ent`, `rngtest` and `dieharder` tests. These are the results obtained with pico-rng:

```
$ ent sample.rng
Entropy = 7.999999 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1073741824 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1073741824 samples is 839.56, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4993 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141625006 (error 0.00 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000006 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
```
- Entropy test should produce an ideal result of `8`, as each byte has `8` bits.
- Optimum compression test should produce an ideal result of 0 percent.
- Chi square should be called with different sample tests and produce a chi square distribution.
- Arithmetic mean should produce an ideal result of `127.5`.
- Pi test should be equal to pi number.
- Serial correlation should be `0`.

These results show that pico-rng is pretty random.


```bash
$ cat sample.rng |Â rngtest

In these results, we have a total number of trials `429496 (429141+355)`.
- The acceptable result of Monobit test is `1` failed trial for every `9662` trials. For `429496` trials, the number of failed trials should be less than `429496/9662=44.45`.
- The acceptable result of Poker test is `1` failed trial for every `10078` trials. For `429496` trials, the number of failed trials should be less than `42.62`.

# About the random number generator
Raspberry Pi Pico has a Ring Oscillator (ROSC) that produces a random bit, despite that it is not intended for secure applications. In general, ROSC produce weak/correlated random bits. Thus, we increase the randomness by adding more entropy sources:
- A random word produced by ROSC.
- A current timestamp.
- A read from an open GPIO pin.

The produced random word is then passed through a whitener. In particular, the FowlerâNollâVo hash function is used as a whitener.

Finally, the word is packed into a byte array and returned to the host.

The performance of this RNG can be analyzed with [pico_rng_analyze.py](firmware/pico_rng_analyze.py) script and typical tools, such as `ent`, `rngtest` or `dierharder`. See results above.
